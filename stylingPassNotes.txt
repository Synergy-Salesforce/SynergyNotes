- Home Page - 
Request to tour is lined up should be lower even to the homepage card.
- Properties with availability text - could be center and smaller - off set in mobile
- padding in general could be use on the request a tour and the properties with availability text
- padding on the text in the request a tour form

-Single Location page - 
- Picture is too large - hides the dots when the device screen is small.
- padding on the single location would be nice
- a background color to the card 
- font colors to yellow(?)/white(?)
- pill or badges blue styling on the fieldname

- header nav section
- header is a bit too big - probably due to the image size - hides link in mobile
- nav links should be right center of the block

- location list
- align justify to the top - since it seems like they are align towards the center
- padding on the description text

- Application page
- background color
- color scheme away from salesforce i.e. buttons
- general padding

- unit component
- card should be the same size
- background main container off white
- card could be blue
- text could be white
- border(?)
- drop shadow on the card


3-5 presentation practice before presenting


background color - off white
component background color - blue(?)
white text/yellow text(?)
have consistent color scheme


Ethan suggestion to have a
- main container component
	- header component contains nav
	- content container sits below the div and conditional rendering
		- width to 80% and margin to auto - center content push everything in ensuring a bit of white space
